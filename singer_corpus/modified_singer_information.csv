His parents were S. W. Leslin and Pasquel Wasam Gayaneris. His older siblings are Nalini, Rukmani Chandra, Padmasiri and Chitrani. Keerthi studied at Dharmaraja College up until his GCE O/level examination. Keerthi's passion for music was greatly influenced by his family where he grew up amidst soothing music all around his home. The melodious singing prowess of his mother was a huge influence on Keerthi. His father could play the harmonium. Keerthi was just ten years old when his father developed an illness and eventually passed away, eventually leaving his mother to shoulder the responsibility of five children as well as taking over her husband's business. Keerthi's mother's dream was to make him a doctor but he started to follow a course on lathe machinery at the Technical College, after his O Levels. His brother Padmasiri Pasquel was the first member of the family to bring a guitar to their home. He had joined a group called 'Halians' where he played the lead guitar. But Padmasiri never allowed Keerthi to touch the instrument, because he feared the boy might neglect studies if he focused on music. He had three cousin brothers - Bandula, Lalith and Ranjith, who frequently patronized their home to learn the guitar from Padmasiri. So Keerthi started learning about guitar chords from Bandula, on the sly. Gradually, Keerthi learnt the guitar secretly. He took part in school concerts as he could sing well.","As time went on, Keerthi became a permanent member of the 'Galaxies'. Though Keerthi played the bass guitar, at these recordings he was given small percussion instruments like maracas, clappers, triangle and bells. Keerthi was invited by Gretian Ananda to play the bass guitar for four new songs he was planning to record. Rookantha to be on the keyboard, Sarath Wickrema the accordion and Mahinda Bandara was slotted for the lead. The first milestone song was  'Etha Duraka Desa Pawela'. He has been performing for more than three decades and has won a number of awards. Keerthi is a judge on the National reality show 'Derana Dream Star' and sets the record as the only judge in Sri Lanka to sit for 10 consecutive seasons in a reality show beginning from 2008 until today. He has been active in music education and in social welfare."

Perera was a Buddhist while Mendis was a Methodist bringing both Christian and Buddhist values and music traditions to the family. Amardeva was introduced to music at a young age by his father who crafted and repaired violins at Moratumulla Wadu Kaarmika Vidyalaya (Carpentry School). Amaradeva would often strum the violin while his mother sang hymns. Another family influence was Amaradeva's elder brother who taught Indian classical music to him. Amaradeva was presented with his own instrument on his seventh birthday which was a Japanese made tin violin by his father.Amaradeva obtained his early education under Ven. Malalankara Nayaka Tero of the Koralawella temple. With the development of his musical talent, Amaradeva was asked to recite poems and prayers at the temple; he was subsequently picked to lead the village choir. He was first entered into Sri Saddharmodaya Buddhist mixed School in Koralawella. The principal of that school, Mr. Ku. Jo. Fernando was an active member of Hela Hawula and had a close connection with Kumaratunga Munidasa. He knew about Amaradeva's talent and introduced him to Kumaratunga. Amaradeva was lucky to be appreciated by Kumaratunga for his singing talent. Since he had a chance to accompany all these scholars during his childhood, he had an interest in national identity and language. When he was studying in grade five at Koralawella School, a music teacher called Mr. W. J. Fernando was transferred to his school from Kalutara. Hence, W.J. Fernando was the first school music teacher of Amaradeva. He realized Amaradeva's talent and directed him on singing and playing. Under his guidance, Amaradeva won all the school singing competitions. Even the teacher let him conduct the classroom when he was not there.","Many consider Pandit Amaradeva's contribution to the development of Sinhala music as unmatched; hence, he is occasionally cited as the ""Maestro of Sri Lankan Music"". In the mid-1950s, Amaradeva in his Janagayana project consulted experts of the Kandyan dance tradition like Panibharatha, Kiriganita, Gunamala, Ukkuva and Suramba in his path to understand what constituted Sinhala folk music. Noting that it mostly revolved around a single melody, he decided to add verses that would lead up to the central melody which would now be a chorus thus forming two parts (unseen earlier in traditional Sri Lankan music) removing restrictions that had existed earlier. In doing so, Amaradeva created a uniquely Sinhalese music style that stayed true to folk tradition while incorporating outside influences. His work was vital in the creation of the sarala gee genre practised subsequently by artists like Sanath Nandasiri, Victor Ratnayake, T.M. Jayaratne, Sunil Edirisinghe and Gunadasa Kapuge etc. Pandit Amaradeva had been the recipient of numerous awards including the Philippine Ramon Magsaysay Award (2001), Indian Padma Sri Award (2002) and Sri Lankan ""President's Award of Kala Keerthi"" (1986) and Deshamanya Award (1998). In 2003 the French government awarded him the prestigious honour; Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. Notably he still remains the most popular artist as confirmed by Nielsen Media Research findings. He has also represented Sri Lanka in many forums including the UNESCO 1967 Manila Symposium. The University of Kelaniya conferred on him the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Fine Arts) Honoris Causa in 1991 and the University of Ruhuna and University of Peradeniya conferred on him the Degree of Doctor of Letters, Honoris Causa in 1993 and 1998.

Its music can be described as a blend of experimental rock, grunge, psychedelic and stoner rock. It was founded in 2001 by Mirshad Buckman (lyricist, vocalist and guitarist), Shanka Samarasinghe (drummer), Asela Bandara (bass guitarist) and Dhanushka Samarasinghe (guitarist). The band's EP Rock 'N Roll is My Anarchy was released in 2005. In 2014, the band underwent a line-up change when Harshan Gallage joined as the drummer. A brain child of Mirshad Buckman and Shanka Samarasinghe: inspired to form a band after meeting in school and sharing similar interests in music, the band was put together with Asela Bandara and Dhanushka Samarasinghe as the original line-up. Asela Bandara named the band Paranoid Earthling. Appearing for a guest performance at a local college concert in late 2001, the band covered Nirvana which caught the attention of the youngsters and made a major breakthrough in the rock culture of Sri Lanka. They have since appeared at numerous concerts with a few international tours. Central to Paranoid Earthling's music is the political economic and socio-cultural issues surrounding the day-to-day life of an average Sri Lankan youth. The composition derives from personal experiences as well as from contemporary political and social issues at large. Many youth have found refuge in Paranoid Earthling's rebellious song-writing as it gives them a voice. By questioning concepts such as democracy, violence, conflict, religion and social hierarchies, their music calls for social change and transformation."

Second, in a family of five, her father, John Daniel worked on a plantation and her mother, Helen Rose was a teacher. She grew up in Colombo and had her early education at St. Matthew's School and then moved on to St. Clare's School, Wellawatte. She was married to veteran dramatist, actor and singer, Eddie Jayamanne, whom she fell in love with as a result of her close association with him, when performing in dramas produced by ""Minerva Dramatic Club"" founded by B. A. W. Jayamanne. They lived at ""Jaya Ruk"", at Angurukaramulla, Negombo."," As a little girl, Daniels showed an inborn talent to sing and dance. At the age of seven, she was picked to sing Christmas carols. Impressed with her ability to sing, dance, and also to act, she was selected to perform a main role in a Christmas play, 'The Shoemaker's Wife'. The stage play was trained and presented by St. Clare's School, Wellawatte. Watching her play this role much enthusiastically, Walter Abeysinghe, a drama producer sought permission from her father, to invite her to play the lead role of 'Sita' in his drama 'Ramayanaya.' Thus, in 1935 at the age of just 12 years she performed in this stage play, presented by the 'Sinhala Natya Sabha'. This marked the beginning of an illustrious career that would span over four decades. As her performances were highly appreciated by the packed audience, well-known dramatist Dick Dias chose her for two of his stage plays, ""Jana Kiharanaya"" and ""Mayawathie"". She was now flooded with stage dramas, as she became Mayawathi in Charles Dias' 'Mayawathi', Juliet in a Sinhala adaption of Romeo and Juliet, playing the lead female role in all of them. Rukmani performed her singing career as a simple singer on Sri Lankan radio in the mid-1940s. Gabriel Gunaratne, who was in charge of recording songs at the then His Master's Voice (HMV) Gramophone Records Company, was the permanent music director of the company. She was introduced to the H. W. Rupasinghe one day in October 1938 by Gunaratne. Rupasinghe, who saw Rukmani's singing prowess, chose her for the first album, which was launched by Master His Voice No. 9300. With her first audio recording of the famous song ""Siri Buddhagaya Vihare"" with Master ""H. W. Rupasinghe"". in 1938 at the age of 15, she captured the hearts of the masses and she shaped her career from that of an actress to that of an actress turned singer. This song was recorded to 78 rpm (gramophone) record label HMV with the number N-9300 and issued in 1939 by the Cargills Ltd, local agents for HMV.  Her unique voice attracted many music directors, as her singing career moved from the stage to the silver screen. Joining Rupasinghe Master's band as a regular singer, she faced three challenges at the time. That is, she had not studied Hindustani classical music properly as well as had to compete with renowned singers of that year such as Lakshmi Bai, Annie Boteju and Susila Jayasinghe. The third was the language challenge. She did not know how to read or write Sinhala and she used to write it all down in English. Due to the vocal training given by Rupasinghe Master through those songs, she soon became a simple classical singer as well as the most popular young singer on the His Masters Voice record company. During 1938-45, she recorded 44 songs for HMV Records. Rukmani sang almost all the Sinhala songs composed in Hindi and Vanga classical songs sung by Kumari Jutika Roy, then popularly known as ""Bhajan Songstress"" in India.It was also, around this time that her name underwent a change from Daisy Daniels to the well known 'Rukmani Devi'.
