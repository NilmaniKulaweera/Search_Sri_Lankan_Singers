His brother Padmasiri Pasquel was the first member of the family to bring a guitar to their home. He had joined a group called ‘Halians’ where he played the lead guitar. But Padmasiri never allowed Keerthi to touch the instrument, because he feared the boy might neglect studies if he focused on music. He had three cousin brothers – Bandula, Lalith and Ranjith, who frequently patronized their home to learn the guitar from Padmasiri. So Keerthi started learning about guitar chords from Bandula, on the sly. Gradually, Keerthi learnt the guitar secretly. He took part in school concerts as he could sing well. When he was in Grade 9, the school had a talent contest and Keerthi was the obvious choice in the singing segment. He even trained the final ten students with whom he himself competed. The grand finale was held at the Kandy Buddhist Centre. Keerthi sang Victor Rathnayake’s ‘Adawan Desin’. Unfortunately for him, the music orchestra backing him gave a low tempo and the song finally ended up like a poem. All his hopes of winning the contest were smashed. The guys whom he taught overtook him. But he never gave up. Having learnt the guitar from Bandula, Keerthi and a few teenage friends formed a small musical group which played at functions but was never paid. One day, Keerthi’s group was invited to perform at a wedding. Riyaldeen, having heard about Keerthi’s exceptional skills, invited him to join a group headed by Stanley Peiris as a bass guitarist. The band was named ‘GALAXIES’.  When  Keerthi was attending the technical course, he tried to join the Army band and went for interviews too. He was called for training during this period. But when he told this to Stanley Peiris, he had asked him to remain in the band as the bass guitarist.    Keerthi married Muditha Fernando in 1978 and had a daughter and son. His eldest daughter, Dinesha Pasquel is now married domiciled in the UK with her husband and son. His son, Kasun Pasquel works for Expolanka Group. Kasun is married to Chethana Ranasinghe who is also blooming in the music industry. In 1994 his first marriage ended and he married Chandana Mudalige in 1995. He has two daughters from Chandana – Charuni Pasquel who is a law graduate and Natalia Pasquel -  a business management graduate. Keerthi feels he is the luckiest father on earth because of the unity and caring attitudes of his four children.    ","As time went on, Keerthi became a permanent member of the 'Galaxies'. Though Keerthi played the bass guitar, at these recordings he was given small percussion instruments like maracas, clappers, triangle and bells. Keerthi was invited by Gretian Ananda to play the bass guitar for four new songs he was planning to record. Rookantha to be on the keyboard, Sarath Wickrema the accordion and Mahinda Bandara was slotted for the lead. The first milestone song was ‘ Etha Duraka Desa Pawela’.  Later on, Keerthi befriended Thilak Dias who had a unique playing style with the guitar with a gifted knack of playing it with his fingers giving an exceptional output. Since then Keerthi, being intrigued by Thilak’s style, also used this finger style on the bass guitar for all his recordings and he started getting more recordings as a bass guitarist. In addition to Stanley Peiris, Keerthi was fortunate to get work in the recordings of Sarath Dassanayake, Rohana Weerasinghe and other veterans of the time. He was invited to join Patrick Denipitiya’s Combo as a bass guitarist and vocalist singing songs of Clarence Wijewardana, Amaradewa, Nihal Nelson, Neville Fernando, Nanda Malini, Rukmani Devi and a host of others. This, he did even with Galaxies. Keerthi always believes that his present vocal prowess is blessed with a blend of all such great singers. He played as the bass guitar for Mount Chimes too.  As his brother Padmasiri returned to the country in 1982, they formed a band called ‘Colour Lite’ with Mahinda, Padmasiri, Gamini Perera and Ranjith Silva.It is during this time that Visharada Nanda Malini had been on the lookout for a male chorus singer. She had asked Stanley if he could recommend somebody. Stanley had suggested Keerthi’s name. This resulted in a memorable chapter in Keerthi’s musical career. From 1982 to 1985 he was a chorus singer and bass guitarist in Nanda Malini’s Sathyaye Geethaya, contributing for 530 concerts. That was an era when they had four shows every weekend. Sathyaye Geethaya was virtually an institution for Keerthi who learnt how to work methodically and organize things systematically. In the meantime, Keerthi also played for Lata Rathriya, Baig Geethika and concerts of Freddie Silva and Jothi Rathriya of H. R. Jothipala. In 1981, Keerthi helped his friend Sunil Dharmasena produce a cassette where Keerthi too contributed one of his songs, ‘Hanthane Nil Kanduweti Athare’ to the cassette. It went down on record as Keerthi’s first cassette song too. This unexpected turn of events, made Keerthi ambitious to do his own songs. This was the era when a cassette revolution was emerging in the country and Keerthi and his team mates were busy with recordings. Song recordings at Bishop’s House Joe Neth Studio had to cease by 10 pm. When there were days they finished off around 8.30 pm, the intervening time was used to record songs for Keerthi. An orchestra guy would make a melody and Keerthi would sing. Creations like Oba Ma Hamu Wu, Neela Ahase and Kavikaraye were songs that came as a result of such instant recordings done during the gaps. By then Keerthi had a collection of ten of his own songs. Keerthi used to play for ITN’s popular Madu Rasanga segment presented by veterans Ariyasiri Vithanage and Indunil Dissanayake. PLA Somapala was the producer. Generally, for Madu Rasanga, the original artistes and musicians mimed for the original tracks, but it was done skillfully. During one such recording in 1983, the original artiste had not turned up on time and the musicians had to idle for some time. The boys in the technical team, knowing Keerthi had some songs of his own suggested that Keerthi recorded one of his songs for Madu Rasanga. The boys enthusiastically did the recording ‘Neela Ahase Sende Walaa’, in the absence of producer PLA Somapala. In 1984, much to Keerthi’s surprise, this song was telecast on ITN’s Madu Rasanga and it became an overnight hit. That was Keerthi’s biggest turning point in his tuneful career and was followed up with another hit song ‘Sinhala Raja Kaale’. During the Nitin Mukesh concert at the Galle Face Green in 1985, Keerthi was an orchestra member. Suddenly Rajini Selvanayagam came up to them with a sheet of paper and wanted someone to do a nice Kaffirinna melody for the words ‘Sinhala Raja Kaale Newei’ since her troupe had a dance item lined up during the concert. Ranjith Perera instantly made a tune while Gretian, Mervyn Perera, Mahinda and Keerthi were slotted to sing it. But on the day of the show, there was only one microphone before Keerthi. TNL’s Shan Wickremesinghe did the video recording and it had picked only Keerthi’s voice. So, it automatically became Keerthi’s song later on. Keerthi’s maiden solo musical concert ‘Keerthi Gee Sankalpana’ was held on January 28, 1988 followed by another performance the following day at the Lumbini Theatre, bringing him incredible feedback from his fans. But circumstances led him to leave the band eventually and in 1989 he joined Super Fortunes led by Ranjith Perera.  Following a series of unsuccessful business ventures Keerthi and his family left to New Zealand for four years. Following his return, Suresh de Silva requested him to voice a melody he had given him in 1998. And that song was none other than ‘Kandula Ithin Samaweyan’. It became a hit and virtually marked the second innings of Keerthi’s musical journey. Keerthi revived his studio ‘Sonic Recording Studio’ with digital state of the art equipment and gave a great service to all artists in the music industry for a very nominal fee. He continued publishing his Sonic diary which listed the contact numbers of all those in the music field. This diary is of immense service to all those in the field even today. He went on many overseas musical tours very often to countries such as USA, Canada, United Kingdom, Italy, France, Japan, Middle East and performed in various musical shows and other events.     "

","  Mathangi ""Maya"" Arulpragasam was born on 18 July 1975, in Hounslow, London, the daughter of Arul Pragasam, a Sri Lankan Tamil engineer, writer, and activist, and his wife, Kala, a seamstress. When she was six months old, her family moved to Jaffna in northern Sri Lanka, where her brother Sugu was born. There, her father adopted the name Arular and became a political activist and founding member of the Eelam Revolutionary Organisation of Students (EROS), a political Tamil group affiliated with the LTTE. The first 11 years of Arulpragasam's life were marked by displacement caused by the Sri Lankan Civil War. Her family went into hiding from the Sri Lankan Army, and Arulpragasam had little contact with her father during this period. She has described her family as living in ""big-time"" poverty during her childhood but also recalls some of her happiest memories from growing up in Jaffna. Maya attended Catholic convent schools such as the Holy Family Convent, Jaffna, where she developed her art skills—painting in particular—to work her way up her class.During the civil war, soldiers would put guns through holes in the windows and shoot at the school, which she notes as ""fun."" Her classmates were trained to dive under the table or run next door to English-language schools that, according to her, ""wouldn't get shot."" Arulpragasam lived on a road alongside much of her extended family and played inside temples and churches in the town. Due to safety concerns, Arulpragasam's mother relocated herself and her children to Madras in India, where they lived in a derelict house and received sporadic visits from their father, who was introduced to the children as their ""uncle"" in order to protect them. The family, minus Arular, then resettled in Jaffna temporarily, only to see the war escalate further in northeast Sri Lanka. During this time, nine-year-old Arulpragasam's primary school was destroyed in a government raid.Her mother then returned with her children back to London in 1986, a week before Arulpragasam's 11th birthday, where they were housed as refugees. Her father arrived on the island and became an independent peace mediator between the two sides of the civil war in the late 1980s–2010. Arulpragasam spent the rest of her childhood and teenage years living on the Phipps Bridge Estate in the Mitcham district of south London, where she learned to speak English, while her mother brought the children up on a modest income. Arulpragasam entered the final year of primary school in the autumn of 1986 and quickly mastered the English language. Hers was one of only two Asian families on the estate at the time, in an atmosphere she has described as ""incredibly racist.""While living in England and raising her children, Arulpragasam's mother became a Christian in 1990 and worked as a seamstress for the Royal Family for much of her career. She worked from her home in London's Tooting area. Arulpragasam has had a difficult relationship with her father, due to his political activities in the 1980s and complete absence during much of her life. Prior to the release of the first album, which Arulpragasam had named after her father, he emailed her: ""This is Dad. Change the title of your album. I'm really proud. Just read about you in the Sri Lanka Times. Dad."" She chose not to change the album title. Arulpragasam attended the Ricards Lodge High School in Wimbledon. Following high school, she attended Central Saint Martins by gaining admittance through unconventional means despite not having formally applied. In 2000, she graduated from London's Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design with a degree in fine art, film, and video.   M.I.A. met DJ Diplo at the Fabric Club in London, in 2003, and the two were romantically involved for five years.From 2006 to 2008, M.I.A. lived in the Bedford–Stuyvesant neighbourhood of Brooklyn, New York, where she met Benjamin Bronfman, an American scion of the Bronfman business family and the Lehman banking family who founded Lehman Brothers. They became engaged and she gave birth to their son, Ikhyd Edgar Arular Bronfman, on 13 February 2009, three days after performing at the Grammy Awards. In February 2012, it was announced that she and Bronfman had split. In a 2013 interview with Ferrari Sheppard, M.I.A. commented on her relationship with Bronfman and his family's wealth: ""I think it's weird. It's not that I got with Ben and then suddenly I was a billionaire. You know? I got with Ben, and I realised that we do come from different worlds, but it's interesting that it is more about the concepts of, again, elitism and power. Who Ben is, on paper, sounds way more powerful than who I am because of where he comes from.""   ",

47,Mohideen Baig,1919,1991,1934–1991,Singer,Vocals,"Born on 5 December 1918 in Salem South India as the third of the family, Baig belonged to an Indian tribe called Pathan.

60,W. D. Amaradeva,1927,2016,1947–2016,"Musician, singer, composer, Chancellor of the University of the Visual and Performing Arts",," Amaradeva was born the youngest of seven children to a carpenter, Wannakuwatta Waduge Don Ginoris Perera, and Balapuwaduge Maggie Weslina Mendis at Janapriya Mawatha in Koralawella, Moratuwa. Perera was a Buddhist while Mendis was a Methodist bringing both Christian and Buddhist values and music traditions to the family. Amardeva was introduced to music at a young age by his father who crafted and repaired violins at Moratumulla Wadu Kaarmika Vidyalaya (Carpentry School). Amaradeva would often strum the violin while his mother sang hymns. Another family influence was Amaradeva's elder brother who taught Indian classical music to him. Amaradeva was presented with his own instrument on his seventh birthday which was a Japanese made tin violin by his father.Amaradeva obtained his early education under Ven. Malalankara Nayaka Tero of the Koralawella temple. With the development of his musical talent, Amaradeva was asked to recite poems and prayers at the temple; he was subsequently picked to lead the village choir. He was first entered into Sri Saddharmodaya Buddhist mixed School in Koralawella. The principal of that school, Mr. Ku. Jo. Fernando was an active member of Hela Hawula and had a close connection with Kumaratunga Munidasa. He knew about Amaradeva's talent and introduced him to Kumaratunga. Amaradeva was lucky to be appreciated by Kumaratunga for his singing talent. Since he had a chance to accompany all these scholars during his childhood, he had an interest in national identity and language. When he was studying in grade five at Koralawella School, a music teacher called Mr. W. J. Fernando was transferred to his school from Kalutara. Hence, W.J. Fernando was the first school music teacher of Amaradeva. He realized Amaradeva's talent and directed him on singing and playing. Under his guidance, Amaradeva won all the school singing competitions. Even the teacher let him conduct the classroom when he was not there.While attending the school, he won a poetry contest held at the Moratuwa Vidyalaya. Amaradeva also led the school choir to a triumphant showing at a contest held by the Colombo Arts Society. His poetry win prompted school teachers to get him a showcase to recite poetry on Radio Ceylon. In 1945 Amaradeva won a gold medal at a music and violin contest held by Jana Kala Mandalaya Amaradeva's fame that was limited only to the Koralawella, started spreading over other areas. Because of his increasing popularity, several schools offered him scholarships. Amaradeva entered Sri Sumangala College, Panadura after completing his primary education with a scholarship for English. At the school, he formed a friendship with the music teacher and principal Danister Thomas Fernando, who was the elder brother of Amaradeva's first music teacher W. J. Fernando.  D. T. Fernando who was living in Kalutara helped Amaradeva get into Kalutara Vidyalaya and subsequently to Siddharta Vidyalaya Balapitiya.He was married to Wimala Gunaratne in 1962. She was a past student of Musaeus College, Colombo. She was a teacher, who completed Twenty years of teaching career. Meanwhile, Wimala joined with dance troupe conducted by Panibharatha and excelled her acting abilities at Tower Hall. The couple has three children: Ranjana, Subhani, and Priyanvada. Wimala Amaradeva died on 8 March 2021 at the age of 86.   ","Young Amaradewa met Sunil Santha, a prominent artist at the time at one of Sunil Santha's concerts. Since he showed interest Sunil Santha invited Amaradewa to audition at Chitrasena studios. There he played in front of Sunil Santha, Chitrasena and A. J. Ranasinghe and impressed them. This meeting and related events are described in detail by A. J. Ranasinghe, Dr. Nandadasa Kodagoda and Sunil Santha. After the audition Sunil Santha brought Amaradewa to stay at Chitrasena Studios, his roommate was A. J. Ranasinghe. By chance filming of the film Ashokamala commenced nearby. Gerard J. Pieris of Moratuwa introduced Amaradeva to Mohamed Ghouse Master who was handling the music for the film and Ghouse recognising Amaradeva's skill enlisted him as the top violinist in his orchestra. Amaradeva left his studies and accompanied Ghouse to India to work on the film. He would play a triple role of singing, dancing and acting on the film with the song ""Ayi Yameku Kale Ale."". At Lucknow, Bhatkande Amaradeva came under the tutelage of the supreme violinist Vishnu Govind Jog who regarded the young Sri Lankan as a prized pupil and protégé. Amaradeva graduated after five years with two Visharads as both a violinist and vocalist. He found steady work as an artist on Radio Ceylon, where his unique vision and talent could be exhibited to an audience wider than he had ever before known – earning him a position at the Bhatkhande Music Institute in Lucknow, India. In 1955, Amaradeva won the All India violin competition. After extensive training, Albert returned to Sri Lanka as Pandit Wannakuwatta waduge Don Amaradeva. The name Amaradeva which translates as Immortal god was given to him by Prof. Ediriweera Sarachchandra (Sri Lanka's foremost playwright and a close associate). During this time, Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) had only begun emerging as an independent nation, and the question of what Sri Lankan music was, was slowly being addressed with equal vigour by intellectuals, artists and the general public. In response to the spirit of these times, Amaradeva began interweaving indigenous folk music with the North Indian ragas he had studied in Lucknow, thereby giving expression to a more sophisticated cadence. His other innovations include his experimentation with Western harmonies and counter-harmonies, as well as with South Indian and Tamil musical forms.

70,Rukmani Devi,1923,1978,1936–1978,Singer and actress,,"Rukmani Devi, was born as Daisy Rasammah Daniels to a Tamil Colombo Chetty Christian family on 15 January 1923 at Ramboda in Nuwara Eliya, Sri Lanka. Second, in a family of five, her father, John Daniel worked on a plantation and her mother, Helen Rose was a teacher. She grew up in Colombo and had her early education at St. Matthew's School and then moved on to St. Clare's School, Wellawatte.  She was married to veteran dramatist, actor and singer, Eddie Jayamanne, whom she fell in love with as a result of her close association with him, when performing in dramas produced by ""Minerva Dramatic Club"" founded by B. A. W. Jayamanne. They lived at ""Jaya Ruk"", at Angurukaramulla, Negombo.   "," As a little girl, Daniels showed an inborn talent to sing and dance. At the age of seven, she was picked to sing Christmas carols. Impressed with her ability to sing, dance, and also to act, she was selected to perform a main role in a Christmas play, 'The Shoemaker's Wife'. The stage play was trained and presented by St. Clare's School, Wellawatte. Watching her play this role much enthusiastically, Walter Abeysinghe, a drama producer sought permission from her father, to invite her to play the lead role of 'Sita' in his drama 'Ramayanaya.' Thus, in 1935 at the age of just 12 years she performed in this stage play, presented by the 'Sinhala Natya Sabha'. This marked the beginning of an illustrious career that would span over four decades. As her performances were highly appreciated by the packed audience, well-known dramatist Dick Dias chose her for two of his stage plays, ""Jana Kiharanaya"" and ""Mayawathie"". She was now flooded with stage dramas, as she became Mayawathi in Charles Dias' 'Mayawathi', Juliet in a Sinhala adaption of Romeo and Juliet, playing the lead female role in all of them. Rukmani performed her singing career as a simple singer on Sri Lankan radio in the mid-1940s. Gabriel Gunaratne, who was in charge of recording songs at the then His Master's Voice (HMV) Gramophone Records Company, was the permanent music director of the company. She was introduced to the H. W. Rupasinghe one day in October 1938 by Gunaratne. Rupasinghe, who saw Rukmani's singing prowess, chose her for the first album, which was launched by Master His Voice No. 9300. With her first audio recording of the famous song ""Siri Buddhagaya Vihare"" with Master ""H. W. Rupasinghe"". in 1938 at the age of 15, she captured the hearts of the masses and she shaped her career from that of an actress to that of an actress turned singer. This song was recorded to 78 rpm (gramophone) record label HMV with the number N-9300 and issued in 1939 by the Cargills Ltd, local agents for HMV.  Her unique voice attracted many music directors, as her singing career moved from the stage to the silver screen. Joining Rupasinghe Master's band as a regular singer, she faced three challenges at the time. That is, she had not studied Hindustani classical music properly as well as had to compete with renowned singers of that year such as Lakshmi Bai, Annie Boteju and Susila Jayasinghe. The third was the language challenge. She did not know how to read or write Sinhala and she used to write it all down in English. Due to the vocal training given by Rupasinghe Master through those songs, she soon became a simple classical singer as well as the most popular young singer on the His Masters Voice record company. During 1938-45, she recorded 44 songs for HMV Records. Rukmani sang almost all the Sinhala songs composed in Hindi and Vanga classical songs sung by Kumari Jutika Roy, then popularly known as ""Bhajan Songstress"" in India.It was also, around this time that her name underwent a change from Daisy Daniels to the well known 'Rukmani Devi'. There are two schools of thinking as to how the name ""Rukmani Devi"" originated. According to one school, the late H. W. Rupasinghe maestro created the name, while the other believe that Jayantha Weerasekara and Michael Sannas Liyanage who is in his 90s, created it. Entering the stage, Rukmani had the opportunity to perform in Noorthi dramas such as Janakiharanaya, Rohini and Mayawathi. Since 1940, B. A. W. Jayamanne, founder of ""Minerva Dramatic Club"" of Negombo took Rukmani to perform remarkable roles in his dramas, such as 'Apparition', 'Broken Promise', 'Changing Fate, 'Defeated Aim', 'Evasive Denial', 'Fanatic Faith', 'Grisly Guardian', 'Hasty Decision' and lastly 'Irangani'. Above-mentioned plays followed the English alphabet. The popular play 'Broken Promise' (Kadawunu Poronduwa), was adapted into a film by B. A. W. Jayamanne. This was the first Sinhala film – Kadawunu Poronduwa, screened on 21 January 1947. Rukmani Devi, who also began her film career through the role of 'Ranjani' in this film, also became the first local cinema actress. Her film career, which thus began spread over a period of more than three decades. According to Sri Lankeya Cinema Vanshaya (pp 637 – 638) written by Nuwan Nayanajith Kumara, from Kadawunu Poronduwa in 1947 to Ara Soyza in 1984, Rukmani Devi had played different roles in 99 films, up to the time of her death. Rukmani Devi won the first place in the ""Popular Singing Series"" in the 1953 Radio Artists Classification Test.An equally talented singer, some of the immortal songs she sang for films are Sandyave Sriya for 'Kadawunu Poronduwa', Pinsara Mage Soyura for 'Kapati Arakshakaya', Gala Kandeni, and Moranawa Preme Hade for 'Weradun Kurumanama', Nindede Rathri Yahane for 'Peralena Iranama', Mavila Pena vi Rupe for 'Kela Handa', Pem Sihina Loke Maya for 'Mathabhedaya', Melavi Yanna Hada Mage for 'Daiva Yogaya', Suva dena Sita Sanasum for 'Ladalu' and Doi Doi Puta for 'Ahasin Polavata'. In 1975 Rukmani sing ""Pem Rajatahane"" with Milton Mallawarachchi. Rukmani made duets with amateur singers since the 1960s, such as: song ""Ada Handapana Paya Hari Lassanai"" with Sujatha Perera (Attanayake), ""Gang Ivuru Paduru Gane"" with Sidney Attygalle, ""Kokilaya Keviliya"", ""Denna Piriye Dethata Oya Detha"" with H. R. Jothipala, and ""Ithin Palak Nehe Kumariya"" with J. A. Milton Perera.In the mid sixties she joined the Sinhala calypso musical group 'Los Cabelleros' led by late Neville Fernando.

He passed the final exam as the first in the first division in Sitar and Vocals, the first non-Indian Asian to do so. Joseph graduated in “Sangeetha Vishaarada” from the Bhathkanda University of Musicology and returned to Sri Lanka in 1952 and shunned his English name, Joseph John and adapted Sunil Santha. He then adopted the name ""Sunil Santha"". During his studies in India he regularly contributed to Sri Lankan newspapers. On 2 March 1946 Santha held a recital for the Kumaratunga Commemoration ceremony and was asked to record for Radio Ceylon. Over the next six years, he would have a string of popular songs including ""Olu Pipila"", ""Handapane"", ""Ho Ga Rella Negay"", ""Bowitiya Dan Palukan Vare"", ""Suwada Rosa Mal Nela"", ""Kokilayange"", and ""Mihikathanalawala.""  The song ""Olu Pipila"" is the first song to be recorded at then Radion Ceylon. Santha stressed his Sinhala heritage in his songs opting to sing in Sinhala rather than English and not copy Hindustani and Tamil songs of India.

Marcelline Jayakody.In 1952, Santha was banned from Radio Ceylon after refusing to audition for Indian musician Ratanjankar, whom the corporation had brought from South India to oversee the direction of music on their stations. Santha experienced monetary problems after being terminated from Radio Ceylon. His songbooks were plagiarised, his songs were sold without consent or royalties by copyright violators. He tried his hand at various trades like photography, selling clothes and electronics over the next few years.In 1953, Santha started a small school at the Maradana Newton building, vowing to teach 10 pupils for free. He often helped fellow artists and promising talent. He wrote to newspapers about the plight of Ananda Samarakoon and tried to bring attention to the composer of the national anthem.  At a time when Albert Perera (later known as W.D. Amaradeva) who used to play violin at Sunil's performances, was in need of help, Sunil gave him two of his music classes at Panadura to teach and make a living.  Sunil also helped collect money to send Amaradewa for further studies in India.In 1955 journalist DB Dhanapala started a campaign to expose Santha's plight and raised some money through his column on Lankadeepa. In 1967 Director General Mr. Neville Jayaweera asked Santha to come back to the national radio service. Santha worked with W.D. Amaradeva and H. W. Rupasinghe to audition the artists. Sunil Shantha was the first to compose the world's first one note song which is a masterpiece, in 1967. It is named as ""Gum Gum Gum"" (Wasp Song), which is sung in the tune of a Wasp's hum. In Sinhalese, the song is called as ""ගුම් ගුම් ගුම් (බඹර ගීය)"". Sunil Shantha used to sing this masterpiece along with his colleague Ivo Denis for the performances and for the Radio Ceylon by the time. Santha moved into his uncle's house in 1970 as he was evicted from the rental house he lived in. In 1977 a record titled Sunil Gee was produced. In 1980, a record titled Seegiril Gee was produced. This contained a set of songs written and composed by Sunil with melodies using only four notes. The lyrics were based on Sigiri Kurutu Gee (sigiri graffiti). The songs are remarkable in that they used traditional Sri Lankan drums and other instruments to create a unique sound.   "

","He first appears in a lead role as a university student named Bandu in the 1969 blockbuster Hanthane Kathawa directed by Sugathapala Senarath Yapa. But according to local film historians cite the first time he encountered in front of a camera was in the film Manamalayo three years ago. Although a Romeo and Juliet story was made in 1969, he was not the lead actor.In a career that spanned nearly two decades, he contributed to more than 120 films, 114 of which starred the protagonist. Some of the most popular films include Ahas Gauwa(1974), Eya Den Loku Lamayek (1975), Ponmani (1977), Bambaru Avith (1977), Ganga Addara (1980), Baddegama (1980), Paradige (1980), Maha Gedara (1980), Kedapathaka Chaya (1989), and Kristhu Charithaya (1990). He acted in one English-language film, The God King, and one Tamil film, Nanguram. Meanwhile, the Vijaya-Malini era also came to the fore when he became the dream boy in the 1980s Sinhala cinema. According to the critic Gamini Weragama, Vijaya's performance in the film Maruwa Samaga Wase is close to Toshiro Mifune's supernatural rule in the Rashomon film.He also performed as a playback singer in several films; recorded more than 100 songs; and produced two films, Waradata Danduwam and Samawa which was released after his death. From 1983 to 1988 (once after the assassination) he was a consistently popular actor at six Sarasaviya Award Ceremonies. But he received the award for the Best Actor only for the role in Kedapathaka Chaya at the OCIC and the Swarna Sankha Festival in 1989, but he was not fortunate enough to see it. After two years of demise, he won the Sarasaviya Award for Best Playback singer for his song 'Walakulak Gena Muwa Karumu Hiru' for Saharawe Sihiniya and his song 'Sara Guwana Vida Neguna' for the Dolos Mahe Pahana. The only proof that he turned to singing as well as songwriting is the song 'Mulu Hadinma Oba Hata Adarei'.   Kumaratunga started his political career in the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP). He later joined the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and became its first national organizer. In 1977, he ran unsuccessfully for the Katana seat in Parliament. Five years later, he was active in the 1982 presidential campaign of Hector Kobbekaduwa. After the election, he was accused of being a Naxalite and jailed under the emergency regulations of President J. R. Jayewardene, but he was never charged. He ran as the SLFP candidate in a by-election in Mahara in 1983 and was threatened by United National Party (UNP) supporters. An attempt was made on his life, and one of his friends was killed. Kumaratunga won the first vote count, and a recount was ordered. At that point, a blackout occurred at the counting centre. By the time electricity was restored, the UNP candidate had recorded a victory by a few votes. The opposition alleged that someone had ""eaten some of Vijaya's votes to ensure UNP victory"".He founded the Sri Lanka Mahajana Party (SLMP), which campaigned for peace in the Sri Lankan Civil War. Under his new party, he contested a Minneriya by-election and finished second, behind the UNP candidate—relegating his old party, SLFP, to third place. The SLMP went on to contest several other by-elections, including in Kundasale and Habaraduwa, but did not live up to expectations.in 1986, Kumaranatunga visited Jaffna, then controlled by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). He visited the Nallur Murugan Temple and met with local Tamil civilians, as well as several LTTE youth leaders. In his final public address, to a large crowd in Colombo's Campbell Park on 28 January 1988, Kumaratunga lashed out at the UNP, SLFP, and Janatha Vimuthki Peramuna (JVP) parties for failing to address the needs of the hour. He also voiced concerns about the SLFP's links with the JVP, a Marxist–Leninist party involved in two armed uprisings against the Sri Lankan government.In 1988, the SLMP reached an agreement with several other left-wing parties—including the LSSP, Nava Sama Samaja Party (NSSP), Sri Lanka Communist Party, and Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF)—to form the United Socialist Alliance (USA). A few days prior to the establishment of the new alliance, Kumaranatunga was assassinated. The agreement was signed by party leaders at his funeral. The USA won a large number of seats in the newly formed provincial councils in an election boycotted by the main opposition SLFP. However, in the 1988 presidential election, the USA candidate, Ossie Abeygunasekera, finished in last place. In the 1989 parliamentary elections, USA candidates won three seats, but none of the winners represented the SLMP.   "
97,W. D. Amaradeva,1927,2016,1947–2016,"Musician, singer, composer, Chancellor of the University of the Visual and Performing Arts",," Amaradeva was born the youngest of seven children to a carpenter, Wannakuwatta Waduge Don Ginoris Perera, and Balapuwaduge Maggie Weslina Mendis at Janapriya Mawatha in Koralawella, Moratuwa. Perera was a Buddhist while Mendis was a Methodist bringing both Christian and Buddhist values and music traditions to the family. Amardeva was introduced to music at a young age by his father who crafted and repaired violins at Moratumulla Wadu Kaarmika Vidyalaya (Carpentry School). Amaradeva would often strum the violin while his mother sang hymns. Another family influence was Amaradeva's elder brother who taught Indian classical music to him. Amaradeva was presented with his own instrument on his seventh birthday which was a Japanese made tin violin by his father.Amaradeva obtained his early education under Ven. Malalankara Nayaka Tero of the Koralawella temple. With the development of his musical talent, Amaradeva was asked to recite poems and prayers at the temple; he was subsequently picked to lead the village choir. He was first entered into Sri Saddharmodaya Buddhist mixed School in Koralawella. The principal of that school, Mr. Ku. Jo. Fernando was an active member of Hela Hawula and had a close connection with Kumaratunga Munidasa. He knew about Amaradeva's talent and introduced him to Kumaratunga. Amaradeva was lucky to be appreciated by Kumaratunga for his singing talent. Since he had a chance to accompany all these scholars during his childhood, he had an interest in national identity and language. When he was studying in grade five at Koralawella School, a music teacher called Mr. W. J. Fernando was transferred to his school from Kalutara. Hence, W.J. Fernando was the first school music teacher of Amaradeva. He realized Amaradeva's talent and directed him on singing and playing. Under his guidance, Amaradeva won all the school singing competitions. Even the teacher let him conduct the classroom when he was not there.While attending the school, he won a poetry contest held at the Moratuwa Vidyalaya. Amaradeva also led the school choir to a triumphant showing at a contest held by the Colombo Arts Society. His poetry win prompted school teachers to get him a showcase to recite poetry on Radio Ceylon. In 1945 Amaradeva won a gold medal at a music and violin contest held by Jana Kala Mandalaya Amaradeva's fame that was limited only to the Koralawella, started spreading over other areas. Because of his increasing popularity, several schools offered him scholarships. Amaradeva entered Sri Sumangala College, Panadura after completing his primary education with a scholarship for English. At the school, he formed a friendship with the music teacher and principal Danister Thomas Fernando, who was the elder brother of Amaradeva's first music teacher W. J. Fernando.  D. T. Fernando who was living in Kalutara helped Amaradeva get into Kalutara Vidyalaya and subsequently to Siddharta Vidyalaya Balapitiya.He was married to Wimala Gunaratne in 1962. She was a past student of Musaeus College, Colombo. She was a teacher, who completed Twenty years of teaching career. Meanwhile, Wimala joined with dance troupe conducted by Panibharatha and excelled her acting abilities at Tower Hall. The couple has three children: Ranjana, Subhani, and Priyanvada. Wimala Amaradeva died on 8 March 2021 at the age of 86.   ","Young Amaradewa met Sunil Santha, a prominent artist at the time at one of Sunil Santha's concerts. Since he showed interest Sunil Santha invited Amaradewa to audition at Chitrasena studios. There he played in front of Sunil Santha, Chitrasena and A. J. Ranasinghe and impressed them. This meeting and related events are described in detail by A. J. Ranasinghe, Dr. Nandadasa Kodagoda and Sunil Santha. After the audition Sunil Santha brought Amaradewa to stay at Chitrasena Studios, his roommate was A. J. Ranasinghe. By chance filming of the film Ashokamala commenced nearby. Gerard J. Pieris of Moratuwa introduced Amaradeva to Mohamed Ghouse Master who was handling the music for the film and Ghouse recognising Amaradeva's skill enlisted him as the top violinist in his orchestra. Amaradeva left his studies and accompanied Ghouse to India to work on the film. He would play a triple role of singing, dancing and acting on the film with the song ""Ayi Yameku Kale Ale."". At Lucknow, Bhatkande Amaradeva came under the tutelage of the supreme violinist Vishnu Govind Jog who regarded the young Sri Lankan as a prized pupil and protégé. Amaradeva graduated after five years with two Visharads as both a violinist and vocalist. He found steady work as an artist on Radio Ceylon, where his unique vision and talent could be exhibited to an audience wider than he had ever before known – earning him a position at the Bhatkhande Music Institute in Lucknow, India. In 1955, Amaradeva won the All India violin competition. After extensive training, Albert returned to Sri Lanka as Pandit Wannakuwatta waduge Don Amaradeva. The name Amaradeva which translates as Immortal god was given to him by Prof. Ediriweera Sarachchandra (Sri Lanka's foremost playwright and a close associate). During this time, Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) had only begun emerging as an independent nation, and the question of what Sri Lankan music was, was slowly being addressed with equal vigour by intellectuals, artists and the general public. In response to the spirit of these times, Amaradeva began interweaving indigenous folk music with the North Indian ragas he had studied in Lucknow, thereby giving expression to a more sophisticated cadence. His other innovations include his experimentation with Western harmonies and counter-harmonies, as well as with South Indian and Tamil musical forms. In the song 'Ran Dahadiya Bindu Bindu', Amaradeva incorporated the Baila music of his hometown. His opus, however, remains the work he did with Sri Lanka's celebrated lyricist Mahagama Sekera, in exploring the contours of fusing classical Sinhala poetry with his unique musical intonation. In time, Amaradeva's music came to reflect an entire philosophy, reflective of the spirit of a nation. He has composed music for ballet (Karadiya, Nala Damayanthi, etc.), film (Ranmuthu Duwa, Gam Peraliya, Ran Salu, Delovak Athara, Gatavarayo, Rena Girav, Thun Man Handiya, Puran Appu, etc.), theatre (Wessantara, etc.), radio and television. He is the creator of the mando-harp, a musical instrument combining the mandolin and the harp.Amaradeva is credited as having introduced artists such as Nanda Malini and Edward Jayakody to the wider audience. Many artists such as Sunil Edirisinghe, Victor Ratnayake and Neela Wickramasinghe have credited him as a major influence on their work. Dr. Lester James Peries has described his voice as the greatest musical instrument. Amaradeva has also been described as the defining musician of Sinhala civilization for his role in the creation of a national tradition.Amaradeva was married to Wimala, together they had one son (Ranjana Amaradeva), and two daughters (Subhani Amaradeva, herself a talented vocalist, and Priyanvada Amaradeva). He was a patron of numerous charities. W. D. Amaradeva was the second Chancellor of the University of the Visual and Performing Arts. In 2015 Amaradeva made a duet with popular young artist, Umaria Sinhawansa before his demise.Tha particular song Hanthana Sihine Has acrossed more than 13 million views on YouTube.   "
